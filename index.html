          <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

          <h2>Carspotting</h2>
          <p>
            Carspotting is basically just searching and filming the cool cars you see around, it can be in car meets but also just on my way to school or in vacation... For example I went to Milano last summer and I went to some of the best hotels of the city to film the cars that were parked in front !

          <h2>Sneakers</h2>
            <p>
              If you are not familiar with this term, it's basically shoes that most of the time are produced in limited quantities but are wanted by a lot of people. That allow a parallel market of sneakers reselling that allows me to earn some money so I can then buy sneaker for me more easyly.

            <h2>Video games</h2>
              <p>
                I used to play and watch video games a lot during my childhood. Since I'm a student, and since I have my own business for example, I don't play anymore on my computer... I still watch some videos on Youtube but less than before.
